Multimodal-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of a multimodal Twitter Sentiment Analysis project that aims to classify sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) using both textual and optional contextual features. The project explores multiple machine learning and deep learning models, such as SVM, Decision Tree, Bi-LSTM, and BART, applied to a dataset of 1.6 million tweets. It also leverages GloVe embeddings for richer semantic understanding of the tweets.
